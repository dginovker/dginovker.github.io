<h2 id="#Introduction">Introduction</h2>
Welcome to my BlackBerry Coop review. Through this page, you'll learn about my first University coop experience, including my thoughts, goals and a bit of background on both my position and what the company was about.


<h2 id="About_BlackBerry">About BlackBerry</h2>
BlackBerry Limited, previously known as Research In Motion, is a Canadian tech company that focuses on secure enterprise software and the Internet of things.<sup><a href="#cyberscoop">[1]</a></sup> Founded in 1984 by Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin, BlackBerry has become a multinational corporation best known for their BlackBerry devices and their cybersecurity.<sup><a href="#nationalpost">[2]</a></sup>


<h2 id="Goals">Goals</h2>

<h3 id="Learn_new_skillsets">Learn new skillsets</h3>
Challenging yourself on a technical front was always a goal I had looking forwards to coop in general. I had heard that test automation was a very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none">Jack of all Trades</a> position, so I was excited to learn about all the tools they used - with the goal of knowing how I could set up a testing infrastructure from scratch, on my own.

Needless to say, I learned <i>a lot</i>. In my spare time I do a lot of development work, but I never really understood what was going on behind the scenes. <i>How does the buildbot know how to run my program?</i>, or <i>What is this "test coverage" sheet they keep talking about?</i> where always questions I kind of <i>knew</i> the answer, but not really. But that's only the surface; because after working this role at BlackBerry, not only did I acheive my goal, but I also learned so many more things relating to test automation as well. In order of what I find most significant to least, 
<ul>
  <li>Android Espresso tests</li>
  <li>Ui Automator</li>
  <li>Jenkins</li>
  <li>Gradle tasks</li>
  <li>Gerrit code reviews</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Performance">Performance</h3>
When I first heard that BlackBerry had accepted me as a coop, I endured a giant rush of joy, relief and euphoria. I was excited to go to Waterloo where many of my friends lived, excited to see the BlackBerry headquarters and excited to think about how my daily routine might be; but then I had a thought. I realized it was one thing to get in and be accepted, but now I had to prove my worth.
<br/><br/>
I set out with a very straightforward goal, of <i>do well, impress my managers, and uphold the reputation of Guelph</i>. I had a lot of fears, worries and doubts, but I knew that I could do it if I just worked hard and pushed myself. So long as I wasn't bored and was doing my best, it seemed like a plan that wouldn't fail. But how would I measure it? How would I know if I performed well? It seemed a bit difficult, so I broke it into two ways.
<br/><br/>
The first was to see how frequently I would receive good feedback on my work. For me it was a very passive way to determine how I was keeping up, and whether I was meeting or exceeding my manager's expectations. I often asked for feedback and made sure to genuinely adjust to it, and as the term went on I continued to improve on my performance and do a better job.
<br/><br/> 
The second, and the bigger measurement I strived for - was "Will my manager <i>ask me</i> to come back?". In my mind, if a coop does a good enough job to be welcomed back to the position, they must have had a strong performance. To achieve this, I continuously pushed myself and found more work. If my tasks for the sprint were complete and all my tests were run, the last thing I would do is sit back and relax. I would seek out extra work from my manager, or if he was busy, I would find work on my own, whether it was improving something that I used regularly or even updating documentation on the wiki. Through this method I inadvertantly started what would become my main project, and through this extra initiative I had earned what I had hoped for; a personal invitation from my manager to come back next year.

<h3 id="Identify_my_weaknesses">Identify my weaknesses</h3>
I've always been a strong programmer, and that was never really my worry. I used to think my weakness was quickly learning the ropes of a large project, but looking back that isn't so much a weakness as something every programmer has to deal with throughout their career. The best way to really determine if I had a weakness would be tohave an identifiable problem I can look at, and see what I can do to make it better.
<br/><br/>
And my manager, Patrick Lam, helped me do just that.
<br/><br/>
I never had an issue with my performance or the quality of my deliverables - but for some reason, my performance would slow down when I worked with a team. For the first month and entering the second, I blamed it on a lot of things. <i>Ohh, these meetings are so useless.. I could have coded the whole thing by now</i> or <i>Oh come on, I can do his part better than he can</i> were some of the excuses I always told myself. But the truth was, it was me. I simply didn't want to hear what other people had to say because <i>I wasn't open enough</i>.

<h2 id="Job_Description">Job Description</h2>
The role of a test automation developer is to design and write programs that run automatic tests on new or existing software. It is a cruicial part of the software development cycle, as it quickly and efficiently determines if a change has broken any other components of the product.<sup><a href="#targetjobs">[3]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Overview">Test Automation in the Mobility Solutions Team at BlackBerry</h3>

As a Test Automation Student on the Mobility Solutions team, my primary role was to provide test suite results as soon as possible after a new productivity app build. Releases were usually done once or twice a week across two different app versions, where one would be hotfixing and the other would be development. Beyond that, my role involved building the test suite infrastructure, and working with developers to fix any problems that were being had.
<br/><br/>
<h3 id="Testing_experience">Testing Experience</h3>
<center><img src="https://dginovker.github.io/files/developers_testing.jpg?raw=true" alt="Photo" style="width: 450px;" id="Developers_testing"/><br/><i>Developers on Twitter attempting to run tests</i></center>
Test automation is a frusturating, yet highly rewarding experience. It's very difficult to get the job right, and requires the individual to have  a lot of knowledge in a lot of different areas of computer science. 
<br/><br/>
In Mobility Solutions at BlackBerry, the suites were done programmatically and ran autonomously, but it was important to quickly respond to any failures. A product failure requires immediate creation of a JIRA task, and it is important to quickly get in touch with the developers behind that component to see if they need more help testing the fixes for the bug. Test failures, where the test crashed or reported inaccurate results, have a slightly lesser priority, where I would identify the root cause and create a JIRA task to be triaged for the fixing of the case itself.
<br/><br/>
However, maintenance and expanding the test infrastructure was an equally large role. While you might not always be the one fixing the broken test cases you report, it's important to know how it's done so you can create more insightful JIRAs for others to follow. Additionally, the creation (or cleanup and optimization) of new suites helps provide new coverage and confidence in builds being prepared for a release; and in some cases, really makes a difference in providing additional data and information.

<h3 id="Main_project">Main Project - Application Profiling Automation</h3>
One day, I was assigned to help him collect some data about the apps. Most of the data was collected by clicking a few buttons on an app, and then reading the log lines to determine various things - such as time taken to load the UX, data, or whatever else it may be.
<br/><br/>
It was a bit odd of a task, and I found it rather mundane and repetitive. I was more than happy to do it, but it just didn't feel like I was being efficient with my time - and half an hour later, I was still not even half way through. So I stopped, and I thought how I could make this better.
<br/><br/>
The first thing I did was write a very hacky, command-line script that would parse out the logfile output and make it so I could just copy the raw data into a file to manipulate. After doing that for a few more minutes, I opened up Android Studio and wrote a second very hacky Espresso test, which I had learned from copy-and-pasting code from other files. Combined, the Espresso test would click the buttons on the app, and my command-line script would parse the output to a file. I sat back for a moment and watched it do my work for me, and continued with some other developments while it worked away.
<br/><br/>
During a meeting the next day, my manager asked about the data and if I got around to collecting it. Alongside the data that I presented, I explained that it was a tedious and potentially inaccurate task due to human error in the repetitive gathering, and that I had written a script to do it for me. Both my manager and one of the more senior technical leads were quite surprised at my initiative and seemed very content about the work I had done, even after I explained many of the scripts limitations and drawbacks.
<br/><br/>
After some discussions about continuing the development of the little project, we agreed it would be best if both myself and Yehia, another coop from the team, recreated the script as a proper test suite - and so we did.
<br/><br/>
Over the course of the next month and a half, Yehia and I worked many long days on producing a robust and flawless suite that would work across many different apps and would be compatible with any supported versions. We removed the need for any overhead by having the suite kick off another program that would fetch the log data, parse it and report it in real-time as the tests ran. By the end, we had a fully autonomous <i>Application Profiling</i> test suite with full documentation, such that anyone on any device could just kick it off and harvest results - many of which included load time for certain screens, data loader measurements, and app start times under various different conditions. 
<br/><br/>
Overall, the final result was a huge success, with many people requesting additional features and functionality too. All the while, both Yehia and I continued to provide test results for new builds, never missing a release. The project is now a large component of the test automation team, and will have its features expanded by the next coop in 2019.

<h2 id="Recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
I found that I had a significant number of meetings - many of which I didn't need to be a part of, or of the 1-hour meeting only five minutes were relevenant to what I was doing. Between the test automation meetings and the CCNT test automation meetings, only one of the two was really necessary. For the greater team meeting, in which everyone under Jeremy's organization gives an update for what they've been doing that week, could be done in a mattermost channel instead. Overall, the time spent in meetings adds up substantially, and even when working through them it feels greatly unnecessary at times.


<h2 id="Conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
The experience I had as a test automation student at BlackBerry was very rewarding, allowing me to learn tons of new testing and Android development tools, and giving me the time to do my own thing. My goals were met and my performance exceeded what was asked, yet I still know where I can focus for improvement in my future positions. 

<h2 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
I'd like to thank Patrick Lam for being honest with me about my mistakes, rather than attempting to avoid conflict. It allowed me to work on issues where I was struggling as quickly as possible, as well as maintain performance that was up to and beyond standards. I would also like to thank Yehia Habib, another coop on the test automation team for keeping me motivated and on track for projects that went into overtime and late into the night. It was certainly a rewarding experience, and would have been difficult without their help.
