Welcome to my BlackBerry Coop review. Through this page, you'll learn about my first University coop experience, including my thoughts, goals and a bit of background on both my position and what the company was about.

<h2 id="Goals">Goals</h2>

<h3 id="Learn_new_skillsets">Learn new skillsets</h3>
Challenging yourself on a technical front was always a goal I had looking forwards to coop in general. I that test automation was a <a href="wikipedia">Jack Of All Trades</a> type position, so I was excited to learn about all the tools they used - with the goal of knowing how I could set up a testing infrastructure from scratch, on my own.

Needless to say, I learned <i>a lot</i>. In my spare time I do a lot of development work, but I never really understood what was going on behind the scenes. <i>How does the buildbot know how to run my program?</i>, or <i>What is this "test coverage" sheet they keep talking about?</i> where always questions I kind of <i>knew</i> the answer, but not really. But that's only the surface; because after working this role at BlackBerry, not only did I acheive my goal, but I also learned so many more things relating to test automation as well. In order of what I find most significant to least, 
<ul>
  <li>Android Espresso tests</li>
  <li>Ui Automator</li>
  <li>Jenkins</li>
  <li>Gradle tasks</li>
  <li>Gerrit code reviews</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Performance">Performance</h3>
do a good job

<h3 id="Identify_my_weaknesses">Identify my weaknesses</h3>
I've always been a strong programmer, and that was never really my worry. I used to think my weakness was quickly learning the ropes of a large project, but looking back that isn't so much a weakness as something every programmer has to deal with throughout their career. The best way to really determine if I had a weakness would be tohave an identifiable problem I can look at, and see what I can do to make it better.

And my manager, Patrick Lam, helped me do just that.

I never had an issue with my performance or the quality of my deliverables - but for some reason, my performance would slow down when I worked with a team. For the first month and entering the second, I blamed it on a lot of things. <i>Ohh, these meetings are so useless.. I could have coded the whole thing by now</i> or <i>Oh come on, I can do his part better than he can</i> were some of the excuses I always told myself. But the truth was, it was me. I simply didn't want to hear what other people had to say because <i>I wasn't open enough</i>.

(talk about conversations with Chris, TJ, Patrick, etc)


<h2 id="Job_Description">Job Description</h2>
...Test automation in general description...

<h3 id="Overview">Test Automation in the Mobility Solutions Team at BlackBerry</h3>

As a Test Automation Student on the Mobility Solutions team, my primary role was to provide test suite results as soon as possible after a new productivity app build. Releases were usually done once or twice a week across two different app versions, where one would be hotfixing and the other would be development. Beyond that, my role involved building the test suite infrastructure, and working with developers to fix any problems that were being had.

Test automation is a frusturating, yet rewarding experience. It takes a high level of effort and work to do that job right, and requires a lot of knowledge in a lot of different areas of computer science. 

In Mobility Solutions at BlackBerry, the suites were done programmatically and ran autonomously, but it was important to quickly respond to any failures. A product failure requires immediate creation of a JIRA task, and it is important to quickly get in touch with the developers behind that component to see if they need more help testing the fixes for the bug. Test failures, where the test crashed or reported inaccurate results, have a slightly lesser priority, where I would identify the root cause and create a JIRA task to be triaged for the fixing of the case itself.
<br/><br/>
However, maintenance and expanding the test infrastructure was an equally large role. While you might not always be the one fixing the broken test cases you report, it's important to know how it's done so you can create more insightful JIRAs for others to follow. Additionally, the creation (or cleanup and optimization) of new suites helps provide new coverage and confidence in builds being prepared for a release; and in some cases, really makes a difference in providing additional data and information.

<h2 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
I'd like to thank Patrick Lam for being honest with me about my mistakes, rather than attempting to avoid conflict. It allowed me to work on issues where I was struggling as quickly as possible, as well as maintain performance that was up to and beyond standards. I would also like to thank Yehia Habib, another coop on the test automation team for keeping me motivated and on track for projects that went into overtime and late into the night. It was certainly a rewarding experience, and would have been difficult without their help.
