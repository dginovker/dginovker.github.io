<h2 id="Job_Description">Job Description</h2>
As a test automation student, my primary role was to provide test suite results as soon as possible after a new app build. Releases were done on a regular basis, with hotfixes going out for the previous versions and new functionality being added for the next release. Beyond that, my role involved building the test suite infrastructure, and working with developers to fix any problems that were being had.
<br/>
In testing, the suites were done programmatically and ran autonomously, but it was important to quickly respond to any failures. A product failure requires immediate creation of a JIRA task, and it is important to quickly get in touch with the developers behind that component to see if they need more help testing the fixes for the bug. Test failures, where the test crashed or reported inaccurate results, have a slightly lesser priority, where I would identify the root cause and create a JIRA task to be triaged for the fixing of the case itself.
<br/>
However, maintenance and expanding the test infrastructure was an equally large role. While you might not always be the one fixing the broken test cases you report, it's important to know how it's done so you can create more insightful JIRAs for others to follow. Additionally, the creation (or cleanup and optimization) of new suites helps provide new coverage and confidence in builds being prepared for a release; and in some cases, really makes a difference in providing additional data and information.
