<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
Welcome to my Manulife coop review! Here you can read about my experience at Manulife, one of the top Canadian insurance companies. Manulife offers tons of opportunities for you to get involved, so it's really what you make of it - and I made the most I possibly could!


<h2 id="About_Manulife">About Manulife</h2>
Manulife, a insurance company created over 130 years ago, is a Canadian multinational insurance company trying to reinvent itself as a tech first company.<sup><a href="#thestar">[1]</a></sup> It's a massive corporation in an old industry, employing around 34,000 employees worldwide - making a massive transformation a little bit difficult.


<h2 id="Job_Description">Job Description</h2>
As a Full Stack Developer, you do a little bit of everything in the software development cycle, as well as work on both the front end and back end of a program. Most Full Stack Developers have years of industry experience in both front and back end, and while I had tons of experience with backend from both work and personal projects, this was the first time I got as involved as I did with the front end. <sup><a href="#careerfoundry">[3]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Overview">Full Stack Developer in the Canadian Division Technology at Manulife</h3>

My primary role was developing an internal hiring tool used to automate onboarding for hiring managers at Manulife. While the company as a whole transformed many of its internal and customer facing tools over the years, one aspect still largly lacking was the hiring process - something nearly my entire team was dedicated to fixing.
<br/><br/>
Automating onboarding wasn't as easy as it could have been - largely due to internal company politics, rather than technical limitations. My tech lead however, Chris Jones (who I knew from Blackberry!), was determined to prove his worth and wasn't going to let anything stop him; we developed numerous workarounds on the backend, using everything from an official API, to testing RPA software, to developing web scraping and automation tools, to deciphering the network packets when on manual registrations and immitating them there.
<br/><br/>
<h3 id="Testing_experience">Testing Experience</h3>
<center><i>Figure 2.0: Developers on Twitter enjoying the testing experience</i></br><img src="https://dginovker.github.io/files/developers_testing.jpg?raw=true" alt="Photo" style="width: 450px;" id="Developers_testing"/><br/></center>
<br/>
Test automation is a highly rewarding, albiet frustrating experience. It's very difficult to get the job right, and requires a lot of knowledge in a lot of different areas of computer science. 
<br/><br/>
On the Mobility Solutions team at BlackBerry, test suites were done programmatically and ran autonomously, but it was important to quickly respond to any failures. A product failure requires the immediate creation of a Jira task, and a sync up with the component's developers for additional testing. Test failures, where the test crashed or reported inaccurate results, have a slightly lesser priority, where the root cause would need to be identified before a Jira task is created and triaged, where it is then fixed by someone on the team.
<br/><br/>
However, maintenance and expanding the test infrastructure was an equally large role. While you might not always be the one fixing the broken test cases you report, it's important to know how it's done so you can create more insightful Jira tasks for others to follow. Additionally, the creation (or cleanup and optimization) of new suites helps provide new coverage and confidence in builds being prepared for a release; in some cases, new coverage makes a really big difference when showing results previously not had.

<h3 id="Skillset">Skills on the Job</h3>
Most of the development on the job was done in Android Studio, but that's not necessarily where all the skills came from. All the hard skills had been taught in school, such as Java, git and basic linux, but beyond the actual development, many additional testing and project management skills were required. Jira and Gerrit were the two dominate tools for product management, where Jira logged tasks and issues for the team to handle and Gerrit provided a clean interfact to peer review code. These, along with Jenkins, a tool for running automated tests, where easily learned on the job and there was always help available from within the team. So as long as you follow along both in school and at work, there's no surprises there!

<h3 id="Main_project">Main Project - Application Profiling Automation</h3>
One day, I was assigned to help him collect some data regarding launch and load times within some of the apps. Most of the data was collected by clicking a few buttons on an app, then reading the log lines and calculating various things.
<br/><br/>
It was a bit odd of a task, and I found it rather mundane and repetitive. I was more than happy to do it, but it just didn't feel like I was being efficient with my time - and half an hour later, I was still not even halfway through. So I stopped, and I thought how I could make this better.
<br/><br/>
The first thing I did was write a very hacky, command-line script that would parse out the logfile and make it so I could just copy the raw data into a file to manipulate. After doing that for a few more minutes, I opened up Android Studio and wrote a second very hacky Espresso test, which I had learned from copy-and-pasting code off other files. Combined, the Espresso test would click the buttons on the app, and my command-line script would parse the output to a file. I sat back for a moment and watched it do my work for me, and continued with some other developments while it worked away.
<br/><br/>
During a meeting the next day, my manager asked about the data and if I got around to collecting it. Alongside the data that I presented, I explained that it was a tedious and potentially inaccurate task due to human error, and that I had written a script to do it for me. While I didn't think much of it, both my manager and one of the more senior technical leads were quite surprised by my initiative and seemed very content about the work I had done, even after I had explained many of the scripts limitations and drawbacks.
<br/><br/>
My manager suggested he was interested in continuing the development of the little project, and we agreed it would be best if both myself and Yehia, another coop from the team, recreated the script as a proper test suite together - and so we did.
<br/><br/>
Over the course of the next month and a half, Yehia and I worked many long days on producing a robust and flawless suite that would be adaptable to many different apps and would be compatible with any supported versions. We additionally removed the need for any overhead, by having the suite kick off another program that would fetch the log data, parse it and report it in real-time as the tests ran. By the end, we had a fully autonomous <i>Application Profiling</i> test suite with full documentation, such that anyone on any device could just kick it off and harvest results - many of which included load time for certain screens, data loader measurements, and app start times under <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/launch-time">hot and cold</a> start conditions. 
<br/><br/>
Overall, the final result was a huge success, with many people requesting additional features and functionality too. All the while, both Yehia and I continued to provide test results for new builds, never missing a release. The project is now a large component of the test automation team, and will have its features expanded by the next coop in 2019.


<h2 id="Goals">Goals</h2>

<h3 id="Get_Involved">Get Involved</h3>
It's my final year at the University of Guelph, and I've only recently started getting involved with clubs, extracurricular programs, and other in-person events, and I've found that I love it. I know the most out of any year so far, and I wanted to put it to good use- getting involved sounded like a no-brainer for doing that.

I knew from the get-go that Manulife had a lot of internal ways to get involved, so I leveraged that when planning out my semesters. With my team beinga part of hiring and onboarding, joining the internal coop hiring committee was one of the first things I did. It gave me the opportunity to develop many of my non-technical skills, as well as be on the other side of the recruiting process for once. Furthermore, entering my second semester, I was asked to run the subcommittee for Software coop hiring - another opportunity I took which proved very helpful for the rest of my term.

Outside the hiring committee, when work turned remote, I started creating non-work related Slack channels to keep people engaged. One of the coop channels I created was the most active Slack channel for the month of June, and the Linux Slack channel grew to be one of the most active Slack channels for full time employees for a short time as well.

Lastly, my efforts in this area didn't go unnoticed - when all the full time employees were given a day off work paid (and the coops weren't, for legal technicalities..), I was asked to help run an event for the coops that day so they could do something more fun at least. I developed an online pixelboard, and as a fun activity coops filled it out that day:

TODO: FIGURE OF PIXEL BOARD

<h3 id="Help_the_Team">Help the Team</h3>
Being a coop, you're supposed to learn - but I also wanted to make a big impact. I wanted to be as helpful to my team as possible, so it wasn't just a one-way relationship. I was heavily motivated to complete this goal, so I worked hard to make it happen in a few different ways:

<h4>Refactor to Redux</h4>
On my own throughout the semester, I learned how to use a React library called Redux, which as the name suggests, heavily reduces the complexity of the app. Having become sophisticated with the library outside work hours, I was able to add the task to our sprint board and complete it no hassle - significantly reducing code debt in one of our main projects.

<h4>Test Coverage</h4>
Who likes testing?? Well.. I sometimes do. There's nothing more satisyfing than knocking out some test coverage on a casual week. For the first time in 5 months, our project had full minimum test coverage (65% of each file), something I worked on casually over the course of 3 weeks near the end of my first semester. This actually ended up being a huge help towards the end of my second term, when my tech lead was leaving the company but also trying to push our app to production right before he left - our high test coverage allowed him to quickly make changes without lowering our quality score too much and get it done in time. Thanks to that, even with him offboarding, our app had crossed the most difficult lines and thrived!

<h3 id="Develop_Lacking_Skills">Develop Lacking Skills</h3>
Manulife takes serious investment into their employees. It's something I will always respect the company for, since it's so uncommon for a company to effecitvely teach their employees what they need to find a different job. Yet, in one town hall, that's almost exactly what one of our VPs said; if it boosts moral, confidence, and you feel like Manulife cares about you, that's better than keeping employees working there for their entire career. And Manulife seriously believed in that.

I took heavy advantage of the free learning courses Manulife purchased for their employees and contractors. Pluralsight was one of them - sort of a premium, paid version of Khan Academy - and you were seriously encouraged to use it! Through skill assessments, Pluralsight courses, and so much more, I learned skills both relevant to my work projects, and ones I worked on at home. Blocking off 4 hours of my calendar on Friday to learn something I would have otherwise learned in school was fantastic, and it really padded my resume too. Some skills that I upscaled using Pluralsight include:

<ul>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Redux</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Node</li>
    <li>Azure Cloud Functions</li>
</ul>

..and so much more. While I started strongest in the back end side of things, by the time I left Manulife, front end development was one of my strong suites, and Javascript became my favorite langauge.

<h2 id="Recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
While Manulife was the best coop experience I had so far, there were some things I wish I could change. Great people were let go from the company, and other great people left on their own accord. Part of me wishes the company succeeded at keeping good talent, and they certainly try to by having opportunities to thank your coworkers and have it seen by management, but I feel like the evidence that great people left the company (either on their own or were let go) shows that it doesn't really work. If I'm honest, I don't know exactly what the solution to this problem would be, and I know they've tried multiple solutions, but it's still a problem they face at the end of the day.
<br/><br/>
My other recommendation is a little more light hearted, and something I did some minor pushes for myself, although I admit it was a little unfeasible; but allow developers to run Linux on their laptops instead of just Windows/MacOS. The tools, software, speed and ability to write code effectively on Linux is debated, but as someone who uses both Windows 10 and Linux frequently, I have to admit they're not even close. The control developers have over their own computers, and the customization they can provide themselves using Linux is unmatched. If you want to increase developer motivation and productivity further, allow Linux to be flashed onto the laptops!

<h2 id="Conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
The experience I had as a test automation development student at BlackBerry was fast paced, and at times very rewarding. It allowed me to learn tons of new testing and Android development tools, while ensuring I was never giving a task I couldn't complete. One of my favorite parts about the experience was just the time allocated to do my own thing, from trying new outreach on projects to working on something wildly different every month. My goals and expectations were met and my performance exceeded, and a bit takeaway is I now  know where I can focus for improvement in my future positions. 

<h2 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
I'd like to thank Patrick Lam for being honest with me about my mistakes, rather than attempting to avoid conflict. It allowed me to work on issues where I was struggling as quickly as possible, as well as maintain performance that was up to and beyond standards. I would also like to thank Yehia Habib, another coop on the test automation team for keeping me motivated and on track for projects that went into overtime and late into the night. It was certainly a experience, and would have been much more difficult without their help.
