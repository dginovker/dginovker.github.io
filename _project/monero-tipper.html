Monero Tipper is a blockchain based, censorship resistant, anonymous and optionally transparent Reddit tipping service. It has been used to donate to artists, developers, and someone even used it to donate to the RedHat CTO.

The project was started in the summer of 2019 and has since made 9 major releases and been hosted on the <a href='https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/MoneroTipper'>monero-ecosystem repo</a>. With over 200 users signed up to the service, it is the first project of its type, and is a one in a thousand project that actually uses a blockchain for legitimate reasons.
