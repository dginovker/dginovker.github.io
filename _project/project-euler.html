title: "Project Euler"
excerpt: "Project Euler is an online programming challenge website where users can write programs to solve different computational problems. Since my first solved problem on 11 Feb 2016, I've completed 24 problems on and off with a median difficulty of 5%.<br/><center><a href='https://projecteuler.net/archives'><img src='https://projecteuler.net/profile/Before.png'></a></center>"
collection: project

<p>The source code for all the completed problems are available on my Github <a href='https://github.com/dginovker/Project-Euler-Solutions'>here</a>. Note that the first 10 problems were written in C, and are not availble since my harddrive died.
<p>
The <a href='https://projecteuler.net/'>homepage</a> of the project states:<blockquote>Each problem has been designed according to a "one-minute rule", which means that although it may take several hours to design a successful algorithm with more difficult problems, an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained on a modestly powered computer in less than one minute.</blockquote>
<p>So, I put a timer in my code. I personally do not consider a problem "complete" until I've fully optimized it to the best of my capabilities, sometimes continuing to work on the project beyond a computational time of less than 1 second.
