title: "Runity"
excerpt: "Runity was an Mmorpg (Rsps) developed mainly at the time by myself, <a href='https://github.com/adamtrinity'>Adam Trinity</a> and <a href='https://github.com/verinia'>Ethan Millard</a>. After launch and at its peak, Runity had reached over 200 players online, and thousands of accounts registered. <br/><center><a href='https://github.com/adamtrinity/Runity-Official-Source'><img src='https://dginovker.github.io/files/Runity.png?raw=true'></a></center>"

<p>In December 2016, I found a project on the Rune-Server gaming forums lead by a user named "Apollo", called <a href="https://archive.fo/CyXmC">OsRoyale</a>. OsRoyale was an attempt to recreate the popular mmo RuneScape as a private server (Rsps) through a custom base which had been under development for years. Upon launch, OsRoyale was a massive success, however began facing both funding and internal issues - and on 21 January 2017, a developer named Nshusa <a href="https://archive.fo/1h6yU">leaked the source</a> of the project, causing demotivation within the remaining team and Apollo wanting to shut it down.
<p>Due to my active community involvement, I offered to join Apollo as a client developer to continue maintaining the project; and with the source already public, he grudgingly agreed. However with only access to the client repo, my work was limited. Nonetheless we kept pushing for roughly two weeks, until Apollo eventually disappeared and stopped replying to any messages relating the server. The game servers itself stay online to this day, but remain stale with no activity for many months.
<p>However, I still had hopes for the project. I reached out to another member of the OsRoyale community, Ethan Millard, and together we rebranded the project under the name "BattleRune". While we had different ideas of where we wanted to go with the project, Ethan and I both agreed we wanted to release something as soon as possible. As days turned to weeks, and countless hours of development seemingly changing nothing, we realized we needed to expand the team. Somehow, and I'm still not sure why, Nshusa decided to join us, and we decided it was a good idea. That didn't last long, and we were back to square one; and that's when we found Adam Trinity.
<p>Adam had been working on the exact same base for his project, Runity. He had come a lot further with his team, but still loved our ideas and our work; so after some back and forth with his team not wanting to merge or give up the source, Ethan managed to get ahold of it regardless and prove our good intentions. We worked on Runity throughout the whole summer for thousands of hours, and built up a large community behind it. Our the Discord server insanely active, and contained around 600 people excited for the release.
<p>Then real life came and I quit to work for BlackBerry. They launched and made something like 17,000$ and Ethan forked the project into his own named Nardah which never saw release.
